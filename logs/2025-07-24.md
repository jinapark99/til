## 📘 Graph Theory – Eulerian vs Hamiltonian vs De Bruijn Graph

### ❓ Problem Background

Genome assembly can be approached in two ways:
- Think of each DNA fragment as a **node** and overlap as **edge** → Hamiltonian path
- Think of each fragment as an **edge** and k-1 overlaps as **node** → Eulerian path (De Bruijn)

I had many questions:
- Why is Eulerian better for genome assembly?
- What makes De Bruijn graphs more efficient?
- What do in-degree and out-degree have to do with Eulerian paths?
- Why do we label edges instead of nodes?


## 🔍 Eulerian vs Hamiltonian – Comparison Table

| Feature                     | Eulerian Path                                | Hamiltonian Path                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Visits                     | Every **edge** exactly once                  | Every **node** exactly once                   |
| Easier to check existence? | ✅ Yes (simple degree conditions)             | ❌ No (NP-complete to decide)                 |
| Used in                    | Genome Assembly (De Bruijn graph), Routing   | TSP, Puzzle solving                           |
| Graph type                 | Requires edge information                    | Requires node connectivity                    |
| Algorithm efficiency       | Polynomial time for path detection           | Often exponential time                        |


## 🐍 Python Practice – Graph Construction & Visualization

I explored graph tools with `networkx`, `pygraphviz`, and `nxpd`:

```python
import networkx as nx
import pygraphviz as pgv
from nxpd import draw, nxpdParams
nxpdParams['show'] = 'ipynb'

G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edge("A", "B", label="ACG")
draw(G, show='ipynb')
```
- DiGraph() builds a directed graph
- add_edge() lets you add edges with labels (like DNA fragments)
- draw() uses Graphviz-style visuals
- nx.topological_sort() helps detect DAGs

## 🧠 Insight
- De Bruijn graphs encode fragments as edges, not nodes.
- This means traversal can focus on edge continuity, not node connectivity.
- Instead of checking all paths like in Hamiltonian problems, we reduce the problem to an Eulerian path check, which is computationally easier.
- Labeling edges with DNA fragments preserves sequence information directly.
- It’s like flipping the problem on its head — and suddenly everything becomes solvable.

## 🧪 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ Eulerian vs Hamiltonian path
- ✅ De Bruijn graph structure- 
- ✅ In-degree = Out-degree for Eulerian cycle
- ✅ Strongly connected components
- ✅ Directed graphs with DiGraph()
- ✅ Topological sort for DAGs
- ✅ Labeling edges for path tracing
- ✅ Node vs Edge-based graph encoding

## 🎯 Reflection
- I started thinking of genome assembly as piecing together puzzle pieces (nodes).
- But switching to edge-based thinking made the picture clearer and more powerful.
- Understanding why De Bruijn graphs optimize the search space gave me a strong grasp of why some problems feel “magically” solvable.
- I also dived deep into Python libraries — asking questions about brackets, parameters, edge labels — and got comfortable manipulating graph objects directly.
- What amazed me the most was how much mathematical theory came alive through graph-based code.
- It felt like solving a mystery with both logic and beauty.
