> **Today I Learned**: Calculating the number of vertices in a tree, definitions of bipartite graphs and Hall’s Theorem, using NetworkX to detect bipartiteness and visualize maximum matching, deriving planar graph constraints via Euler’s formula and double counting, analyzing non-planarity of \(K_6\) and \(K_{3,3}\).

## 📘 Graph Theory – Key Concepts

- **Tree**: If a tree has 17 edges, then vertices \(V = E + 1 = 18\).
- **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be split into two parts with no edges within the same part ⇔ no odd cycles.
- **Hall’s Theorem**: In a bipartite graph \(G=(L\cup R, E)\), a matching covering all of \(L\) exists if and only if for every subset \(S\subseteq L\), \(|N(S)| \ge |S|\).
- **Maximum Matching**: A matching that selects the largest possible number of non-overlapping edges.

## 🐍 Python Code Example

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Build a simple bipartite graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd'), (5, 'e')])

# 2. Check bipartiteness and color nodes
if nx.bipartite.is_bipartite(G):
    left, right = nx.bipartite.sets(G)
    for v in left:
        G.nodes[v]['color'] = 'blue'
    for v in right:
        G.nodes[v]['color'] = 'green'
else:
    print("This graph is not bipartite")

# 3. Compute and highlight maximum matching edges
matching = nx.max_weight_matching(G)
for u, v in matching:
    G.edges[u, v]['color'] = 'red'

# 4. Draw graph
node_colors = [G.nodes[v].get('color', 'gray') for v in G.nodes()]
edge_colors = [G.edges[e].get('color', 'black') for e in G.edges()]
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color=node_colors, edge_color=edge_colors)
plt.show()

## 📄 Planar Graphs & Euler’s Formula

- Euler’s Formula:  for any connected planar graph.
- Double Counting: Let  = number of (face, edge) incidences.
- Each face is bounded by at least 3 edges → .
- Each edge borders at most 2 faces → .
- Result: Combining yields  and with Euler’s formula gives .

## 📎 Applications & Limitations

### Bipartite Graphs
- Use Cases: Matching problems (job assignment, network flow), recommendation systems (user–item mapping), resource scheduling.
- Advantages: Efficient matching algorithms (Hungarian, Hopcroft–Karp), simplified two‑part model.
- Limitations: Cannot represent intra‑group connections (no odd cycles), triangle relationships; unsuitable for certain social networks.
- Comparison Example:
 - (triangle) is non‑bipartite → standard matching algorithms fail.
 - is bipartite but non‑planar → classic flow example.

### Planar Graphs
- Use Cases: Circuit board design (PCB routing), geographic networks (road or subway maps), graph drawing.
- Advantages: Crossing‑free layouts, structural bounds from Euler’s formula.
- Limitations: Edge count limited by , not suitable for highly interconnected networks.
- Comparison Example: and  are non‑planar → cannot be drawn without crossings.
- Trees are planar by definition → minimal structure, always drawable.

## 🧠 Reflection
- Visualizing bipartite checks and matchings in code deepened my understanding.
- The double‑counting argument combined with Euler’s formula elegantly constrains planar graphs.
- The simple bound  is a practical rule for checking planarity.
