> **Today I learned** how UX teams evaluate, refine, and validate design ideas by applying principles like viability, feasibility, desirability, and equity. Also reviewed how competitive audits help in shaping product decisions.

## 📘 UX Design – Module 4: Evaluating and Refining Ideas

Studied key ideas in evaluating and narrowing down design directions, and understanding how to collaborate with stakeholders.  
Covered:

- **Idea Evaluation Criteria**:  
  - *Viable*: financially beneficial to the client  
  - *Feasible*: technically buildable  
  - *Desirable*: solves user problems  
  - *Equitable*: inclusive for all potential users

- **Stakeholder Collaboration**:  
  UX teams often work closely with **marketing and branding teams** when refining product direction.

- **User Needs Validation**:  
  - Use **empathy maps, personas, user stories**, and **journey maps** to define what users need  
  - Align problem → goal → solution using **goal statements**

- **Competitive Audit Insights**:  
  - Review competitor products  
  - Identify key competitors  
  - Understand market positioning  
  - Learn how others solve the same problem for the same audience

- **"How Might We" Ideation Prompts**:  
  - “How” = no fixed answer yet  
  - “Might” = openness to possibilities  
  - “We” = collaborative mindset

## 💡 Insight

- UX evaluation isn’t just about what *sounds* good — it must be **viable, feasible, and solve real problems**.
- Good UX ideas are inclusive: equity means **serving everyone**.
- Competitive audits are not one-off tasks — they should be done **regularly** throughout the project.
- Asking "How might we...?" helps teams stay open-minded and solution-focused.
