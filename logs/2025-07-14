## 🧠 `represent()` – Representing a Target Sum Using Signed Integers from 1 to n (Recursive / Backtracking)

> This Python function determines whether a given integer `value` can be represented  
> using the integers `1` through `n`, each with either a `+` or `-` sign.  
> It returns a list of those signed integers if possible, using recursion and pruning.

### 📌 Key Concepts
- **Recursive function** with clear base case
- **Backtracking** to explore all sign combinations
- **Pruning (early return)** for impossible cases
- **Mathematical filtering** using `total = n(n+1)/2`
- **Subset sum variant** with sign decisions
- Strategy: Choose `+n` if value is positive, `-n` if value is negative

### 🧩 Function Definition
```python
def represent(n, value):
    if n == 0 and value == 0:
        return []

    total = sum(range(1, n + 1))

    # Prune: if value is impossible to reach
    if abs(value) > total or (total - value) % 2 != 0:
        return False

    # Strategy: add or subtract n depending on current value
    if value >= 0:
        return represent(n - 1, value - n) + [n]
    else:
        return represent(n - 1, value + n) + [-n]

### 🔁 Test & Print Result
```python
for v in (7, 15, 22, 33, 40, 47):
    print(v, end='')
    result = represent(9, v)
    if not result:
        print(' is not representable')
    else:
        print('=', end='')
        for i in result:
            if i < 0:
                print(f'{i}', end='')
            else:
                print(f'+{i}', end='')
        print()
        
### ✅ Output
```python
7=+1+2+3-4+5-6+7-8+9
15=+1-2+3+4+5+6-7-8+9
22=+1+2+3+4+5+6+7-8+9
33 is not representable
40 is not representable
47 is not representable

### ✍️ Personal Thought Process & What I Learned
At first, I was confused about this part of the code:

if value >= 0:
    return represent(n - 1, value - n) + [n]
else:
    return represent(n - 1, value + n) + [-n]
    
### I didn't understand:
Why do we subtract n when value is positive?
And where is that [n] or [-n] coming from?
After some careful thinking and tracing the recursion by hand, I realized:
n in the function always refers to the largest number we are currently deciding to use.
We're working backwards: starting from n and going down to 1.
If value is positive, we want to subtract n (i.e., use +n) to get closer to 0.
If value is negative, we want to add n (i.e., use -n) to get closer to 0.
[n] or [-n] is simply the record of the current decision at that recursion level, added to the final list.

In other words:
When value >= 0, we try +n and subtract it from the value.
When value < 0, we try -n and add it to the value.
The final list is built by accumulating these choices in reverse order.

### 🧠 Summary Insight
This problem helped me reinforce how recursion works top-down while the solution builds bottom-up.
It also gave me deeper intuition on when and how to prune unpromising recursive paths based on simple math conditions.
