> **Today I Learned How to count combinations and apply the rule of sum, product, and understand how permutations differ from combinations. Also explored tournament game counting with recursive thinking.



## 📘 Discrete Math – Combinations & Counting Principles

Studied core ideas behind answering "How many?" using combinatorics.  
Covered:

- **Rule of Sum**: \( |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| \) for disjoint sets  
- **Rule of Product**: \( n \times k \) total ways for sequential decisions  
- **Tuples**: Sequences with replacement → \( n^k \)  
- **k-Permutations**: Order matters, no repetition → \( \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \)  
- **k-Combinations**: Order doesn’t matter → \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \)  



## 💡 Insight

- Combinatorics is often about recognizing **what you're counting**:  
  tuples, subsets, sequences, or unordered sets.  
- The difference between combinations and permutations is often **just a division by \( k! \)**.  
- Counting problems often appear deceptively simple — but require **careful analysis of overcounting**.



## 🐍 Python Practice

Used Python's `itertools` to generate:

- Cartesian products for rule of product
- All permutations of a string
- All combinations of elements

Example:

```python
from itertools import combinations

for c in combinations("abcde", 3):
    print("".join(c))

# Output:
abc
abd
abe
acd
ace
ade
bcd
bce
bde
cde
```


## 📄 Problem Summary – Tournament Game Count
```python
def T(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    return (n - 1) + T(n - 1)

print(T(8))  # Output: 28
```


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ Rule of Sum & Product
- ✅ Permutations vs Combinations
- ✅ Recursive counting
- ✅ Avoiding overcounting (e.g. team A vs B = B vs A)
- ✅ itertools in Python for combinatorics



## 🧠 Reflection
- The "Tournament Game" problem was a great reminder to always ask:
- Am I counting the same thing multiple times?
- Practicing both formula-based and code-based approaches really helped reinforce the concept.
- The step from permutation to combination was surprisingly intuitive once I thought of it as just accounting for overcounting order.
