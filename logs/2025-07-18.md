> **Today I learned** the foundational and early-stage UX design process, including empathy-driven research, problem definition, ideation strategies, and common cognitive biases. Also explored how to differentiate qualitative vs. quantitative methods and how to prepare an effective UX portfolio.

## 📘 UX Design – Foundations & User Research

Studied the early UX process from understanding users to generating design ideas.

Covered:

- **UX Design Thinking Process**:  
  Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test

- **UX Research Types**:  
  - *Foundational*: “What should we build?”  
  - *Design*: Improve designs mid-process  
  - *Post-launch*: Understand user experience after release

- **Research Methods**:  
  - *Qualitative*: Observations, interviews  
  - *Quantitative*: Surveys, ratings  
  - *Usability studies*: Observe user interaction with prototypes

- **Common Biases**:  
  - *Sunk cost fallacy*: Can’t quit because we’ve invested  
  - *Recency bias*: Only remember recent info → solved with note-taking  
  - *Confirmation bias*: Only listen to what confirms our beliefs → solved with diverse participants and open-ended questions

- **Portfolio Tips**:  
  - Show your process and thinking, not just final designs  
  - Include goals, challenges, and how you solved them  
  - Highlight learning and growth over perfection

## 💡 Insight

- UX is not about “making things pretty” — it’s about **solving the right problem for the right user**.  
- Research isn’t just before or after the design — it’s a **continuous loop throughout** product development.  
- Even as a beginner, clear storytelling in your portfolio matters more than flashy visuals.

## 🐍 UX Tools Explored

Used:

- **Surveys** for quantitative data  
- **User interviews** for deeper insights  
- **Personas & problem statements** to clarify direction  
- (Coming soon in Course 3) **Figma** for wireframing and prototyping

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ Empathy in UX research  
- ✅ Foundational vs Post-launch insights  
- ✅ Qualitative vs Quantitative data  
- ✅ Bias recognition and correction  
- ✅ Portfolio storytelling  
- ✅ UX research methods and goals

## 🧠 Reflection

- I was eager to jump into Figma, but I now understand **why research and problem framing must come first**.  
- I appreciated how biases can sneak into user interviews — something I hadn’t thought about.  
- Defining the problem clearly with user input makes the rest of the design process far more grounded.  
- The portfolio strategy tips made me rethink how I present my work — it's not just about “what” I made, but *why* and *how*.
