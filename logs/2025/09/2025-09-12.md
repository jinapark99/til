## 📘 UX Portfolio – Reflections

As I wrapped up my portfolio, I identified two major wins:

1. **Clearer storytelling**  
   - Instead of only showing deliverables, I structured each case study around the problem, process, and outcome.  
   - This helped me highlight my design thinking and made the portfolio more engaging and professional.

2. **Improved visual consistency**  
   - I refined typography, spacing, and layout across projects.  
   - These small design details made the presentation feel more polished, credible, and easier to navigate.

## 💡 Insight

The process of revisiting my portfolio showed me the importance of both **narrative flow** and **visual detail**. Balancing these two aspects not only improved readability but also better communicated my strengths as a designer.
