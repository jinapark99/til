## 📘 Modular Arithmetic – Exponentiation

1. **Compute \(2^{238} \bmod 239\)**  
   - Since 239 is prime, Fermat’s Little Theorem applies:  
     \[
     2^{238} \equiv 1 \pmod{239}
     \]  
   ✅ Answer: **1**

2. **Compute \(2^{953} \bmod 239\)**  
   - \(953 = 238 \times 4 + 1\)  
   - Using Fermat’s theorem:  
     \[
     2^{953} \equiv (2^{238})^4 \cdot 2^1 \equiv 1^4 \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{239}
     \]  
   ✅ Answer: **2**

3. **Compute \(\varphi(77)\)**  
   - Factorization: \(77 = 7 \times 11\)  
   - \(\varphi(77) = \varphi(7)\cdot\varphi(11) = 6 \times 10 = 60\)  
   ✅ Answer: **60**

4. **Compute \(34^{60} \bmod 77\)**  
   - Since \(\gcd(34,77)=1\) and \(\varphi(77)=60\):  
     \[
     34^{60} \equiv 1 \pmod{77}
     \]  
   ✅ Answer: **1**

## 📘 Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)

- Goal: Find \(r\) such that  
  \[
  r \equiv r_1 \ (\text{mod } n_1), \quad r \equiv r_2 \ (\text{mod } n_2)
  \]  
  with coprime \(n_1, n_2\).

- Formula:  
  \[
  r = (r_1 \cdot y \cdot n_2 + r_2 \cdot x \cdot n_1) \bmod (n_1 n_2)
  \]  
  where \((x,y)\) is the solution of  
  \[
  n_1x + n_2y = 1
  \]

### ✅ Implementation
```python
def ChineseRemainderTheorem(n1, r1, n2, r2):
    (x, y) = ExtendedEuclid(n1, n2)
    r = (r1 * y * n2 + r2 * x * n1) % (n1 * n2)
    return r


```

### 💡 Insights

- Fermat’s Little Theorem is extremely powerful for reducing exponents when the modulus is prime.

- Euler’s totient function φ(n) generalizes Fermat’s theorem to composite numbers.

- CRT provides a constructive way to combine congruences, useful in cryptography (RSA).

- Fast Modular Exponentiation is essential for handling very large exponents efficiently.

### 🔎 Reflection
I also realized the importance of carefully reading the problem statement — misinterpreting the exponent form gave me wrong answers at first.
Now, I feel much more confident handling modular exponentiation, CRT, and totient function problems for both theoretical and coding questions.
