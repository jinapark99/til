## ðŸ“Œ Research Log: Eye Synchrony Analysis

### What I did today
- Completed draft of **Results** section (descriptive statistics, t-test, effect size, ROC analysis).
- Wrote **Discussion** (highlighting differences with prior work, significance of using non-clinical video data, potential for remote monitoring).

- Created **framework figure** (flowchart in SCI style, hierarchical layout).

### Notes
- Detailed numerical results (means, p-values, AUC, etc.) **not shared** here due to paper submission.  
- Figures used in manuscript are **not uploaded**.  
- This log is for workflow and writing progress tracking only.

### Next Steps
