## 📘 Module 3 – Design Critique Sessions

### What I Learned
- **Feedback is powerful**: It’s not just about pointing out problems, but also about revealing hidden biases and sparking new ideas.  
- **Research matters**: Sometimes the best feedback is realizing that more user research is needed before making design decisions.  
- **Critique sessions are essential**: They give designers a space to present work, exchange perspectives, and gather actionable insights.

### Key Takeaways
- When receiving feedback, I realized it helps me:
  - Notice how personal values and biases can shape design  
  - Brainstorm new questions I wouldn’t have thought of alone  

- When giving feedback:
  - It’s better to suggest further research rather than jumping straight to solutions  
  - Feedback should always be adjusted depending on the situation and context  

- The role of critique sessions:
  - A place to **share designs openly** and **receive structured feedback**  
  - Not about proving who is “right,” but about strengthening the design direction together  

---

### Practical Applications
- After a critique, I shouldn’t just start implementing changes immediately.  
  → I need to pause, **review and synthesize feedback**, then decide what is worth applying.  

- Accessibility is non-negotiable:  
  - Example: If users with limited dexterity struggle with small buttons, the right move is to **increase button size and spacing** for accessibility.  

- For new team members, effective feedback is:
  - Highlighting what they did well, then gently pointing out potential issues and offering to follow up together.

### Reflection
Today’s practice showed me that feedback is less about criticism and more about **collaboration and growth**.  
By practicing design critique sessions, I can build confidence in both asking for feedback and giving it constructively.  
I want to apply this mindset to my own Parkinson’s app project—making sure I test with real users, gather structured feedback, and always prioritize accessibility.
