> Focus: design systems I’ll actually reuse, hi-fi prototyping habits, motion accessibility that scales, and a tidy handoff routine.

---

## 1) Design System — my current baseline
- **Scope**: visual styles (color/images/icons/typography) + usage guidelines + **UI patterns** + minimal code snippets.  
  → Wireframes are **not** part of the DS; they live in process docs.
- **Figma tip**: copy reusable elements from the **Sticker Sheet** (keeps naming, states, and constraints intact).
- **Elevation sanity**: apply elevation to **Navigation / Alerts / Buttons**; keep **background** flat.
- **Operating principle**: *patterns first, screens second* — prevents ad-hoc components later.

**Micro-actions**
- Promote two common flows (e.g., Log-in, Checkout) to **UI patterns** with do/don’t notes.
- Add a “DS quickstart (5 bullets)” to page 1 so teammates land on the right rails.

---

## 2) Hi-Fi Prototyping — minimal but complete
1) Arrange frames in **user-flow order** (first connection = start frame).  
2) Make it interactive: **select the hotspot target** → set trigger/action → **adjust the animation**.  
3) Navigation check:  
   - How does the user move **screen-to-screen**?  
   - Where does the **journey end**?  
   - Are nav icons **discoverable** and labeled?  
4) Validate the flow in **Present/View**.

**What to avoid**
- Truncated titles or over-explained headers. Keep titles short and literal (e.g., *Vacation Photos*).

---

## 3) Motion & Accessibility — rules I’ll follow
- Use motion **only when it serves meaning**, keep durations **≤ 5s**.
- Offer a **Reduced Motion** option (respect OS setting when possible).
- **Never** make a gesture the only path; always provide a button/link alternative.
- Prefer feedback that stays **on the same page** (e.g., “Add to basket” updates the header total with **Instant / Slide-in / Move-out**).
- **Sound**: at minimum provide **On/Off**; let users control volume.
- **Contrast**: critical CTAs get high contrast and explicit labels.

**Quick checklist**
- [ ] Reduced-motion path exists  
- [ ] Non-gesture alternative path exists  
- [ ] CTA contrast & naming pass

---

## 4) Handoff — packaging that saves everyone time
- Bundle: **Design system link + Mocks + Prototype links + Specifications**.
- Set Figma files to **view-only** (comments on), and add a **thumbnail** with deep links + requirements.
- Move older explorations to an **Archive** page to reduce noise.

---

## 5) Research → Insight — four deliberate steps
1) **Gather** all data in one place  
2) **Organize** into a stable structure  
3) Find **themes/patterns** across sources  
4) Turn into **insights** with a recommended action

**Examples I captured**
- **Color/contrast**: low-contrast primary made completion hard → switch to **higher-contrast palette** and verify on CTA states.  
- **Visit reasons**: lists were too narrow → **expand choices + include an “Other” field** to capture real-world inputs.

---

## 6) Portfolio Case Study — lightweight structure
- **Story**: goal/role → constraints/challenges → approach (patterns, experiments) → outcomes/learning.
- **Visuals**: show a thin slice of **Paper Sketch → Wireframe → Low-fi** to make decisions traceable.
- **Tone**: concise + visual; end with **3 key takeaways**.

---

## Mini log (decisions I made today)
- Elevation used **only** for nav/alerts/buttons; background stays flat.
- Reservation feedback happens **on the same page** (basket total updates), not a route change.
- Both **motion** and **sound** are user-controlled by default.

---

## Next (small, concrete)
- [ ] Add a **Reduced Motion** toggle to the Parkinson’s prototype.  
- [ ] Turn Log-in and Checkout into documented **UI patterns**.  
- [ ] Add a one-page **handoff summary** (links + specs) to the Figma cover.
