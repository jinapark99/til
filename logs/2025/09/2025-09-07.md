# 📝 Responsive Web Design - Module 2 Study Notes

> Summary of what I learned about wireframes, mockups, prototypes, design systems, and accessibility.  

---

## 📌 Wireframes & Prototypes
- **Wireframes** are useful in the early stage to explore and compare multiple design ideas quickly.  
- **Prototypes** allow users to actually test interactions such as clicking buttons or adding items to a cart.  
- **Low-fidelity prototypes** are best for communicating big-picture concepts and basic flows.  
- **High-fidelity prototypes** include realistic visuals and functionality that are close to the final product.

## 📌 Mockups
- Mockups emphasize **visual elements** such as:  
  - Color  
  - Typography  
  - Iconography  
- Key considerations when working with colors in mockups:  
  - The ratio of primary to neutral colors  
  - How colors contrast with each other  
  - The emotions conveyed by colors  
  - How users will interpret the colors  
- Mockups are **static, high-fidelity designs** that closely resemble the final product.

## 📌 Design Systems
- A design system ensures **consistency** across projects and teams.  
- Basic components of a design system:  
  - UI components  
  - Visual styles  
  - Guidelines  
- Benefits: improves scalability, efficiency, and overall design quality.  
- In short, it is a **collection of reusable elements and rules**.

## 📌 Accessibility
- **Hierarchical headings:** help structure information so users can easily understand the content hierarchy.  
- **Labels:** provide descriptive language for interactive UI elements such as buttons and input fields.  
- **Annotations:** support assistive technologies by making the navigation flow clear.  
- **Contrast ratio:** ensure text is light against a dark background (or vice versa) for readability.  
- **Heading sizes:** different sizes make headings visually distinct and easier to navigate.

## 📌 Overall Process
1. **Wireframe** – Rough sketches to outline structure and ideas  
2. **Mockup** – Adds visual details, closer to the final design  
3. **Prototype** – Interactive and testable version of the design  
4. **Design System** – Ensures consistency through reusable components and style rules  
5. **Accessibility** – Improves usability for everyone through headings, labels, contrast, and annotations

## ✅ Reflection
- Iteration and client feedback are essential parts of the design process.  
- Remember the distinction: **low-fidelity for quick validation, high-fidelity for realistic testing**.  
- Accessibility is not just a checklist item—it comes from details like contrast, labels, and text hierarchy that directly affect user experience.
