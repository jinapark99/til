The quiz focused on **emphasis, hierarchy, scale, unity, and Gestalt principles**.  
Here is the review of each question with the correct answers and reasoning.

---

### ✅ Q10. Affordance in navigation

**A:** The navigation icons are easy to understand.  

👉 Good affordance means users can clearly understand what an icon does.

## 💡 Insights
- **Emphasis vs. Contrast/Color/Size**: Emphasis is the design principle, while contrast, color, or size are the techniques to achieve it.  
- **Hierarchy** is central to both accessibility and guiding user actions.  
- **Gestalt principles** frequently tested include *Proximity, Similarity, Symmetry, and Closure*.  
- **Value (brightness)** is key to accessibility and contrast-related issues.
