# Today I Learned (2025-09-21)

## 📌 Progress Summary
- Nearly finished drafting the Methods section
- Organized in the sequence: Data Collection → Video Processing → Data Normalization → Synchronization Metric → Statistical Analysis

## 📝 Key Points
- **Video Processing**
  - Extracted iris center coordinates using MediaPipe Face Mesh
  - Processed frames with OpenCV
  - Kept original video resolutions (480p–1080p) to reflect real-world conditions

- **Data Normalization**
  - Applied z-score normalization to coordinate values
  - Included only samples with tracking success rate ≥ 80%
  - Justification: quality control emphasized in prior eye-tracking research

- **Synchronization Metric**
  - Adopted velocity-based correlation (vel_sync) as the main metric
  - Position/cross-correlation checked but not included in final analysis
  - Supported by previous work (Han et al., 2025) highlighting velocity features as sensitive biomarkers

- **Statistical Analysis**
  - Independent samples t-test, Cohen’s d, ROC curve (AUC, 95% CI)
  - Significance threshold set at p < 0.05

## ✅ Next Step
- Start writing Results and Discussion from tomorrow
  - **Results**: descriptive statistics, t-test outcomes, ROC curve performance
  - **Discussion**: comparison with prior studies, implications, limitations, and future directions
