## 📘 UX Design – Building a Professional Presence & Freelancing

### 1. UX Career Paths & Portfolios
- UX designers can begin their careers in **large companies, advertising agencies, start-ups, or design agencies**.  
- A **design portfolio** is the key collection of work samples and skills that designers present to employers.  
- Portfolios demonstrate:  
  - **Openness to continuous learning**  
  - **Practical skills and potential**  
  - **Transparency of past work**  

**Note:** NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) may limit what can be shown in a portfolio, so designers often anonymize or summarize sensitive projects.

### 2. Panel & Whiteboard Interviews
- **Panel interviews**: Conducted by a group, assessing skills, experience, and work ethic.  
  - Designers are expected to **answer questions, demonstrate skills, and present portfolios**.  
- **Whiteboard interviews**: Assess knowledge, thought process, communication, and design capabilities in real time.

### 3. Business Planning for Freelancers
- Key questions for a business plan:  
  - What’s your **brand identity**?  
  - Who are your **competitors**?  
  - What **problems** are you solving for clients?  
- Business paths: design agency, partnership, sole ownership, freelance marketplace.  
- Business plans typically include **expenses, competition, and brand identity** — but not a website.

### 4. Working as a Freelancer
- When setting freelance rates, consider:  
  - **Personal expenses**  
  - **Business expenses**  
  - **Market rate for similar services**  
- Social media strategies:  
  - Post about your new company on personal profiles  
  - Share examples of work  
  - Ask friends & family to help promote  
- Avoid **scope creep** by defining project scope and rates clearly.  
- Scope of Work (SOW): A legally binding document that lists **deliverables, timelines, and payment schedules**.

### 5. Building a Professional Presence
- Portfolio platforms: **Behance, Dribbble** (not Medium or Buzzfeed).  
- Online communities like **Behance** are good for live streaming design processes.  
- The “About Me” page should include: **Passions, contact information, and credentials**.  
- Portfolio writing style: friendly, conversational, and aligned with personal brand (not overly technical).  
- Strong introductions focus on **design philosophy and values**, e.g.,  
  > “I like to create user-centered design experiences for underrepresented audiences.”

## ✨ Reflection
Today I learned how UX designers can structure their professional presence, plan freelance businesses, and prepare for interviews. I also practiced identifying the essential components of portfolios, business plans, and freelancing documents like SOWs. Overall, these concepts help me understand how to present myself not only as a designer but also as a professional service provider.
