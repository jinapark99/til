## 🔍 Today I Learned
While refining the **Eye Sync Analysis Tool**, I learned about:
- Using MediaPipe Face Mesh for iris landmark extraction  
- Cutting YouTube videos with OpenCV and processing them frame by frame  
- Calculating synchronization scores (velocity-based vs position-based)  
- Running statistical tests (t-test, Cohen’s d, ROC curve interpretation)  
- Applying Z-score normalization and filtering low-quality tracking data  

---

## 🧮 Math / Stats
- **Pearson correlation (r):** measures similarity between two eye movement signals  
- **t-test:** compares means of two groups (Parkinson’s vs Control) → significant difference found  
- **Effect size (Cohen’s d):** interprets the magnitude of difference (0.447 → medium effect)  
- **ROC & AUC:** evaluates diagnostic performance, AUC=0.637 indicates *fair* classification

## 💡 Insights
- Even with simple interview clips, it is possible to distinguish Parkinson’s patients from controls.  
- Velocity-based synchronization metrics reveal differences more sensitively than position-based ones.  
- Data preprocessing (Z-score normalization + ≥80% tracking success filter) is crucial for reliable results.

## 🐍 Python Practice
```python
# Z-score normalization
def _zscore_safe(v):
    v = np.asarray(v, dtype=float)
    m, s = np.mean(v), np.std(v)
    return (v - m) / s if s != 0 else v * 0

# Velocity-based synchronization score
dLx, dRx = np.diff(left_x), np.diff(right_x)
score_x = pearsonr(_zscore_safe(dLx), _zscore_safe(dRx))[0]
```

## 📊 Problem Summary
- **Problem:** Can binocular coordination differences between Parkinson’s and control groups be quantified?  
- **Approach:** Extract iris coordinates with MediaPipe → compute synchronization scores → validate with statistics  
- **Result:** Parkinson’s group showed significantly lower scores (p = 0.019, Cohen’s d = 0.447)

## 📝 Reflection
- Still considering which visualizations would strengthen the paper (e.g., ROC curve, bar plots, CI plots).  
- Surprising that even non-experimental interview videos reveal clear group differences.  
- Next step: compare results against **stimulus-based experimental data** to confirm robustness.
