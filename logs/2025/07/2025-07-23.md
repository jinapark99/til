> **Today I learned** how to extract numbers from a file using Python regular expressions, understood the difference between greedy and non-greedy patterns, and practiced debugging with `findall()`.


## 📘 Regular Expressions – Extracting Numbers with `re`

Studied how to use Python's `re` module to extract numeric patterns from text files.  
Covered:

- `re.findall('[0-9]+', line)`: Finds all substrings of one or more digits  
- `'^[1-9][0-9]*'`: Matches a number **only if it begins** at the start of a line  
- `^` = line start anchor, `$` = line end anchor  
- `.` = wildcard for any character  
- `+` = one or more, `*` = zero or more  
- `.*` = greedy match (as much as possible)  
- `.*?` = non-greedy match (as little as possible)  
- Inside `[ ]`, the `.` means a literal period, not a wildcard  
- `re.findall()` always returns a list (even if empty), whereas `re.search()` returns a match object


## 💡 Insight

- `findall('[0-9]+', line)` works best when scanning for numbers anywhere in the line  
- `'^[1-9][0-9]*'` returns `[]` if the number doesn't start at the beginning of the line  
- Greedy vs non-greedy: `'From:.*:'` grabs the longest match, while `'From:.*?:'` stops at the first `:`  
- It's important to print intermediate values (like `num`) to check what your regex is doing  


## 🐍 Python Practice

### ✅ Full Version

```python
import re

sum = 0
file = open('regex_sum_42.txt')
for line in file:
    line = line.rstrip()
    num = re.findall('[0-9]+', line)
    for n in num:
        sum += float(n)

print(int(sum))

#✅ Output: 445833
```

✅ Short List Comprehension Version
```python
import re
print(sum([int(i) for i in re.findall('[0-9]+', open('regex_sum_42.txt').read())]))
```

### 📄 Problem Summary – Sum of Numbers from File
- 📄 File: regex_sum_42.txt
- 🎯 Goal: Extract all numbers from the file and compute their sum
- 🧩 Issue encountered: Using ^[1-9][0-9]* missed many numbers not at line start
- 🛠️ Solution: Use [0-9]+ for numbers anywhere in the line

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ Python re module basics
- ✅ Difference between re.search() vs re.findall()
- ✅ Regex patterns and anchors (^, $, +, *, .*, .*?)
- ✅ File I/O and .rstrip()
- ✅ Debugging with print()
- ✅ Type conversion (float, int)
- ✅ List comprehension

### 🧠 Reflection
- I initially misunderstood why the pattern '^[1-9][0-9]*' wasn’t matching — I learned it only catches numbers at the beginning of a line.
- Using print(num) helped me confirm what the regex was actually capturing, which made debugging easier.
- I got a better understanding of greedy vs non-greedy matches, especially in cases like .* vs .*?.
- I found that list comprehension makes the code much shorter, but understanding the core regex logic first was more important.
- Today was a solid step in mastering regex — it's not just syntax, it's also about thinking precisely about what you're matching.
