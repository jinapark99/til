> **Today I learned** how to solve conditional probability problems, apply Bayes' Theorem, reason about independence, and maximize success probabilities in counterintuitive puzzles like Monty Hall and the prisoner box game.  
> Special focus on problems I got wrong, including the "keep strategy" and conditional logic in restricted sample spaces.



## 📘 Discrete Math – Conditional Probability, Independence & Counterintuitive Probability

Today's topics centered around:

- **Conditional Probability**:  
  \( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \)

- **Bayes’ Theorem**:  
  \( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B)} \)

- **Law of Total Probability**:  
  \( P(W) = P(W \mid B_1)P(B_1) + P(W \mid B_2)P(B_2) \)

- **Independence**:  
  - \( P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) \)
  - \( P(\overline{A} \cap B) = P(\overline{A})P(B) \)
  - But: \( A \perp C \) and \( B \perp C \) does **not** imply \( A \cap B \perp C \)

- **Monty Hall with coin/dice randomness**:
  - If the player keeps their initial choice: success = **1/3**
  - If the player switches: success = **4/9**

- **Two-box prisoner puzzle**:
  - Best strategy: Put **1 white ball in box 1**, rest (14 white + 15 black) in box 2
  - Success probability:  
    \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{14}{29} = \frac{43}{58} \approx 0.741 \)

- **Conditional inversion**:
  - Given that a white ball was picked, what's the probability it came from box 2?
  - Answer: \( \frac{14}{43} \), **not** \( \frac{14}{29} \) (requires full Bayes application)

- **Coursera Quiz Grading**:
  - Even with modules incomplete, 70%+ average = certificate awarded
  - Quiz attempts & partial scores affect final grade



## 💡 Insight

- Conditional probability is subtle: you must redefine your sample space each time.
- Getting a white ball does **not** mean it came from the box with more white balls. Bayes matters!
- Independence between A & C and B & C doesn't guarantee A ∩ B and C are independent.
- Intuition can be wrong in probability — simulation or formula often tells a different story.
- Even if total possibilities feel symmetric, sample space restriction (like A ≠ 1st) changes counts.



## 📄 Problem Summary – Monty Hall (twist w/ dice)

```python
# Keep Strategy: succeed only if initial choice was correct
P_keep = 1/3

# Switch Strategy:
P_wrong_initial = 2/3
P_get_chance = 2/3
P_switch_success = P_wrong_initial * P_get_chance  # = 4/9
```

## 📄 Problem Summary – Two-box Prisoner Puzzle
```python
# Setup:
# Box 1: 1 white
# Box 2: 14 white + 15 black

# Success:
P_success = 1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * (14/29) = 43/58 ≈ 0.741

# Given a white ball was drawn, P(it came from Box 2)?
P = (1/2 * 14/29) / (43/58) = 14/43
```

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ Conditional Probability
- ✅ Bayes’ Theorem & Sample Space Redefinition
- ✅ Law of Total Probability
- ✅ Independence & Misconceptions
- ✅ Probability maximization strategies
- ✅ Simulation vs Calculation thinking
- ✅ Parsing Coursera grade logic

🧠 Reflection
- I was initially confident that keeping in Monty Hall would succeed half the time — but it’s only 1/3.
- I confused P(white | box 2) with P(box 2 | white) — a classic Bayes trap.
- Learned that independence doesn’t transfer through logical combinations unless proven.
- Coursera doesn't require full module completion for certification — but scoring depends on weighted quizzes.
- These problems prove that your intuition isn't always your friend in probability.
