> **Today I learned** about the Gestalt principles and their application in wireframing, along with the basics of information architecture and the importance of lo-fi wireframes for iteration and stakeholder feedback.

## 📘 UX Foundations – Gestalt Principles & Wireframing

Studied key Gestalt principles used in UI design:

- **Proximity**: Items that are close to each other are perceived as a group  
- **Similarity**: Items that look similar (shape, color, size) are grouped  
- **Common Region**: Elements enclosed in a common area are grouped together  
- **Hierarchy**: Users perceive nested or layered information visually  

Also practiced identifying which principle applies in various layout decisions (e.g., logos in bordered areas = Common Region).

## 🧩 Information Architecture (IA)

Reviewed how content should be structured and organized to align with user needs and business goals:

- IA helps with **content placement, hierarchy, and flow**
- Stakeholders assess IA by checking if **content supports business/product goals**
- IA visualizations often resemble **family trees → hierarchy**

## 🧪 Wireframing Process

Explored wireframing workflow and why **lo-fi wireframes** matter:

- Lo-fi wireframes allow **fast iteration** and cheap testing
- They enable designers to gather feedback without needing visual polish
- Digital wireframes add:
  - Important **text labels** (e.g., for icons)
  - Some **contextual content** (like headers)
  - **Structure & spacing** using lines (thicker for sections, thinner for text)

**Paper Wireframe Benefits:**
- Fast to sketch  
- Encourage multiple ideas  
- Easy to discard/change  
- Low cost

## 🔁 Quiz Learnings

- **Gestalt**: Recognized use of Proximity, Similarity, Common Region in layout grouping
- **Wireframe Definitions**: Focused on “basic element layout” over visual detail or interactivity
- **IA Feedback**: Importance of clarity in structure and hierarchy

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- ✅ Gestalt Principles in Design  
- ✅ Lo-fi Wireframe benefits  
- ✅ Close-up vs Big-picture storyboard  
- ✅ Hierarchy in IA  
- ✅ Wireframing iteration workflow

## 🧠 Reflection

- Gestalt principles helped me see how layout alone can imply grouping.  
- Revisiting wireframe purpose reminded me that it’s not about beauty—it’s about clarity and iteration.  
- The “family tree” analogy for IA hierarchy was surprisingly helpful.  
- I now see why close-up storyboards come **after** big-picture storyboards: first the why, then the how.
