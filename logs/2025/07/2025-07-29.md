> **Today I learned** how Python uses sockets to send HTTP requests manually, retrieve text data from web servers, and read HTTP response headers. Also explored how to analyze response metadata like `Content-Type`, `Last-Modified`, and `ETag` using `socket` programming.

## üìò Networks & HTTP with Python Sockets

Studied the process of manually making an HTTP request using the socket library in Python.  
Covered:

- **socket()** to create a communication channel  
- **connect((host, port))** to initiate connection to web server  
- **GET request formatting** with `HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n`  
- Reading data using `recv()` in a loop  
- **Response headers** such as `Last-Modified`, `ETag`, `Content-Length`, etc.

---

## üí° Insight

- The request/response cycle is the heart of HTTP.  
- You can access webpages without a browser ‚Äî just with raw Python and the right format.  
- Headers contain rich metadata like content type, cache control, last modified time ‚Äî which are crucial for understanding server behavior.  
- `GET` is used when clicking links or requesting documents, `POST` is used for form submissions.

## üêç Python Practice

Used Python's `socket` module to connect to a remote server and retrieve raw HTTP responses:

```python
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('data.pr4e.org', 80))
cmd = 'GET http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n'.encode()
mysock.send(cmd)

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if len(data) < 1:
        break
    print(data.decode(), end='')

mysock.close()
```

Sample output included:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Last-Modified: Sat, 13 May 2017 11:22:22 GMT
ETag: "47-54f660924f5c0"
...
```

## üìÑ Problem Summary ‚Äì Header Retrieval Exercise

Task:  
Retrieve the headers for the following URL:  
`http://data.pr4e.org/intro-short.txt`

Extract and fill in:
- `Last-Modified`
- `ETag`
- `Content-Length`
- `Content-Type`
- `Cache-Control`

## üß† Concepts Practiced
- ‚úÖ HTTP Request structure (`GET ... HTTP/1.0`)
- ‚úÖ TCP Port (80 for HTTP)
- ‚úÖ Socket connection in Python
- ‚úÖ Parsing HTTP Response Headers
- ‚úÖ Manual inspection of web response without browser tools

---

## üß† Reflection
- It was exciting to ‚Äútalk‚Äù to a server without a browser ‚Äî just raw Python!
- Understanding headers helped me see how the web is structured behind the scenes.
- This kind of low-level request building is empowering and gave me deeper intuition about what web clients actually do.
- I now understand why `socket` matters even if we often use higher-level libraries like `requests`.
