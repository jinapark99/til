> **Today I learned** and practiced key concepts in Discrete Math and Python.

---

## 📘 Discrete Math
- Studied the basic logic and structure of mathematical proofs.
- Learned about sets, subsets, and set operations.
- 💡 _Insight_: Understanding how Venn diagrams relate to code logic structures helped me visualize conditionals better.

---

## 🐍 Python Practice
- Reviewed recursion and its use in tree traversal algorithms.
- Implemented a backtracking algorithm for the 8-Queens problem.
- 💡 _Key Point_: Recursive calls must track the current state explicitly to avoid unexpected side effects.

### 🧩 8 Queens Puzzle – Counting Solutions

#### 📄 Problem Summary
Modify the code considered in the lectures to find out the number of solutions to the 8 queens puzzle.  
For example, as was explained in the videos, the 4 queens puzzle has 2 solutions.

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- ✅ **Recursion** (재귀 함수)
- ✅ **Backtracking** (백트래킹)
- ✅ **State Tracking** (`perm` 리스트로 상태 기억)
- ✅ **Constraint Filtering** (대각선 충돌 검사로 가지치기)

---

### 💻 My Code

```python
def can_be_extended_to_solution(perm):
    i = len(perm) - 1
    for j in range(i):
        if i - j == abs(perm[i] - perm[j]):
            return False
    return True

def extend(perm, n):
    global count
    if len(perm) == n:
        count += 1
        return

    for k in range(n):
        if k not in perm:
            perm.append(k)

            if can_be_extended_to_solution(perm):
                extend(perm, n)

            perm.pop()

# Run the solver
count = 0
extend(perm=[], n=8)
print("Number of solutions:", count)
```


## 🧾 Output
```text
Number of solutions: 92
This is the total number of valid configurations for the 8-queens puzzle.


### 🧠 Reflection

- Learned that **backtracking** allows us to return to previous states and explore alternate branches — a fundamental and elegant way to solve constrained problems.
- Initially, I misunderstood how `for` loops behave inside **recursive calls**. I thought the loop would terminate once exited, but I realized that each recursive call holds its own loop state, and resumes correctly after each return. This was a tough but crucial insight.
- It felt like I was **duplicating my own mind**, letting each version explore a different path. Recursion reminded me of dancing with logic — graceful but precise.
- I found it fascinating how **probability and combinatorics**, which I once tackled with diagrams on paper in high school, could be **visualized and implemented through code**. Writing these structures made me feel like I was speaking a new language with the computer.
- I want to repeat these mental drills until complex problems start to feel intuitive and even playful to approach.
- The 8-Queens problem made me think about how algorithms can mirror real-life situations — like placing people in a room while avoiding conflicts. This constraint-based thinking feels closely tied to **AI decision-making, puzzle design, and game logic**, and I’d love to explore more of that.
