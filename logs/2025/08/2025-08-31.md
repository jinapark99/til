> **Today I learned** How to use Python to geocode addresses with SQLite and visualize them on a map using `geoload.py`, `geodump.py`, and `where.html`. I practiced editing `where.data`, running the scripts, and capturing results to submit as screenshots for peer review.

---

## 📘 Assignment – Retrieving GEOData

- Downloaded and unzipped **opengeo.zip**.  
- Edited `where.data` to add a new location:  
  ```
  Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea
  ```
- Removed old DB files:  
  ```bash
  rm -f geodata.sqlite where.js
  ```

### 🔹 Step 1 – geoload.py
```bash
python3 geoload.py
```
- Script retrieved data and inserted into `geodata.sqlite`.  
- Verified with line:
  ```
  Retrieving https://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/opengeo?q=Hanyang+University%2C+Seoul%2C+South+Korea
  ```
- 📸 Screenshot #1 captured with the highlighted line.

### 🔹 Step 2 – geodump.py
```bash
python3 geodump.py
```
- Script read DB and produced `where.js`.  
- Verified with line:
  ```
  Hanyang University 37.5557232 127.0436441
  ```
- 📸 Screenshot #2 captured with the highlighted line.

---

### 🔹 Step 3 – where.html
- Opened map in browser:
  ```bash
  open where.html
  ```
- Located **Hanyang University** marker.  
- Zoomed in and included **About the map + timestamp** at bottom.  
- 📸 Screenshot #3 captured.

---

## 💡 Insights
- **DB reset is critical**: must delete `geodata.sqlite` to re-insert new addresses.  
- Geocoding API sometimes skips addresses unless the location is near the top of `where.data`.  
- `decode()` is essential when converting bytes → string in Python 3 network programming.  
- Learned how peer review works: final score only updates after **3 peer reviews** and me reviewing others.

---

## 🧩 Gotchas
- If the new location doesn’t show in CLI:
  - Likely DB wasn’t deleted → always run `rm -f geodata.sqlite where.js`.  
- If the map doesn’t show the new marker:
  - Regenerate `where.js` with `python3 geodump.py`.  
  - Refresh browser or open in incognito mode.  
- Always add **country name** in `where.data` for more reliable geocoding.

## 🔎 Reflection
This assignment helped me practice the full workflow of:
1. Editing input data (`where.data`),
2. Running Python scripts to load & dump geocoded info,
3. Checking output in SQLite/JS,
4. Visualizing with HTML + map, and
5. Submitting evidence (screenshots).

It felt good to see my custom location (**Hanyang University**) successfully appear on the map and confirmed by peers. Now I also understand how Coursera peer review affects my score.
