## 📘 Discrete Math – Modular Arithmetic & Group Theory

### 🔹 Modular Arithmetic (mod n)

- Modular arithmetic operates on integers where results are taken modulo `n`.
- Informally, we calculate as usual but replace any result `x` with `x mod n`.
- Valid for **addition**, **subtraction**, and **multiplication**.
- Example:  
  - \( 7 \mod 5 = 2 \)  
  - \( (12 + 9) \mod 5 = 21 \mod 5 = 1 \)

### 🔹 Formalization with Group Theory

A **group** \( (S, \circ) \) is a set with a binary operation satisfying four properties:

| Property     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Closure      | \( a \circ b \in S \) for all \( a, b \in S \)                              |
| Identity     | \( \exists e \in S \) such that \( a \circ e = e \circ a = a \)             |
| Associativity| \( (a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c) \)                             |
| Inverses     | \( \forall a \in S, \exists b \in S \) such that \( a \circ b = b \circ a = e \) |

If it also satisfies:

- **Commutativity**: \( a \circ b = b \circ a \), then it’s called an **Abelian Group**.
- If the set is finite (|S| < ∞), then it’s a **Finite Group**.

### 🔹 Example: \( (\mathbb{Z}, +) \)

- Set: Integers \( \mathbb{Z} \)
- Operation: Addition (+)
- Identity: 0
- Inverse of \( a \): \( -a \)
- Satisfies commutativity ⇒ Abelian group.

### 💡 Insight

Understanding modular arithmetic through the lens of **group theory** helps formalize and deepen the intuition behind number systems. It’s especially useful when extending to modular inverses, multiplicative groups, and cryptography.

### 🧠 Reflection

- It's fascinating how basic arithmetic transforms into a formal structure with just a few logical rules.
- The fact that modular systems can form groups helps explain why certain modular equations can be solved, and why inverses sometimes exist (and sometimes don’t).
- I want to explore how this links to **modular multiplicative groups**, **Euler’s theorem**, and **cryptographic applications** like RSA.
