> **Today I Learned** how to parse and analyze XML data in Python using `ElementTree`.  
> I resolved subtle bugs, questioned assumptions, and had several "aha" moments while iterating on logic and structure.  
> This was a day of *figuring out the little things that make the big things work.*

## 📘 XML Parsing Basics

- Parsed XML from a URL using:
  ```python
  import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
  import urllib.request as urr
  ```
Used ET.fromstring(data) to convert XML string into a tree structure.

---

## 🔍 Sample Structure
```xml
<comments>
  <comment>
    <name>Chuck</name>
    <count>97</count>
  </comment>
</comments>
```

##🧪 .find() vs .findall() – Real Understanding
- Method	Returns	Use Case
- .find()	First matching Element or None	Access one element safely
- .findall()	List of matching Element objects	Iterate over all elements

---

## 🔍 I asked:
- “Does .findall() return None like .find()?”
- → No. It always returns a list (possibly empty).

- “Do I have to use a loop after findall()?”
- → Yes. It's a list, so you must for it.

---

## 🔎 I realized:
- .text works only on individual Element, not on None or list.
- If I call .text on a failed .find(), it crashes.

---

## 💥 Common Mistakes I Made (and Fixed)
😵 I wrote:add = 
```python
roots.findall('count')
for i in add:
    value += int(i)
```
## 💡 Then I realized:
i is an Element, not a number.
int(i) → ❌
int(i.text) → ✅

---

## 😵 I used sum as a variable:
```python
sum = 0
sum += 1
```

##💡 Then I realized:
sum is a built-in function.
Overwriting it blocks use of sum() later.
I now use value, total, or cnt instead.

---

## 🧩 What didn't work (and why)
```python
for roots in root:
    add = roots.findall('count')
# loop is over...
for i in add:      # ❌ This only uses the *last* roots
    value += int(i.text)
```

## 💡 Lesson:
add is overwritten each loop.
So only the last one is ever used.
Fix: Move the inner for i in add: inside the outer loop.

---

## ✅ Final Working Version
```python
value = 0
for comment in root.findall('.//comment'):
    count = comment.find('count').text
    value += int(count)

print(value)
```

### 💬 Small Questions I Asked (and Learned From)
“Is ElementTree built-in?”
→ ✅ Yes, it's in Python standard library.

“How do I comment multiple lines?”
→ Cmd + / on Mac

“Why is PyCharm giving a yellow warning?”
→ Because I imported a module or defined a variable I hadn’t used yet.

“Why does nothing print?”
→ Because I was shadowing built-ins, iterating incorrectly, or had .text missing.

“Why is value still 0?”
→ Because .findall() was inside a loop, but accumulation happened outside the loop. Only last value was counted.
