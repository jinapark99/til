> **Today I learned**  
How to set up Git version control locally, organize project folders, and connect it to GitHub using a secure personal access token (PAT). I also learned the difference between password authentication and token-based authentication when pushing code.

## 🧱 Git Setup Process – What I Did

### ✅ Step-by-step

1. **Initialized Git in my local project folder**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/py4us
git init
```

2. **Checked what files Git sees**

```bash
git status
```

3. **Added everything to tracking**

```bash
git add .
```

4. **Committed the first snapshot**

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit for py4us project"
```

5. **Created a new GitHub repository (no README)**  
Repository name: `py4us`

6. **Linked local repo to GitHub remote**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/jinapark99/py4us.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

7. **Got prompted for GitHub login — but GitHub doesn't allow passwords anymore!**

## 🔐 What I Learned about Tokens (PAT)

- GitHub now requires **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** instead of passwords
- I generated a token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
  - Gave it a name like `TIL push token`
  - Set expiration to 90 days
  - Selected scope: `repo`
- When `git push` asked for password, I **pasted my token instead**

---

## 🚨 What Went Wrong

- I mistakenly typed:
  ```
  Password: ghp_abc123...
  ```
  as a terminal command → ❌ resulted in `command not found`

✅ I learned that token should be pasted **after** entering the push command and waiting for the terminal to ask for `Username:` and `Password:`.

---

## 🧠 Final Reflection

- I now understand **how local Git and remote GitHub are connected**
- I feel confident organizing folders (`py4us`, `til/2025/07/`) and pushing them
- I learned how authentication shifted from password → token for better security
- Next step: save credentials or use SSH so I don’t have to paste token every time!
