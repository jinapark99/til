# Notes from *Outside the Classroom: Biomedical Engineering*

## General Reflections
- Medicine feels like a natural fit — I could thrive in that environment where many doctors are slower-paced, while I tend to be quicker and more proactive.  
- Genetics seems less aligned with my creativity; I feel more connected to intuitive and experiential research areas.  
- Reading this book feels like visiting Disneyland — full of wonder, imagination, and possibilities.  
- I realized I don’t need to rush. What matters most is exploring what I want and choosing a graduate program that fits my personality and research style.  
- Research feels like where I belong. The idea of dedicating my life to it excites me — like pouring all of my potential into something that changes the world.

## Biomedical Engineering Insights
- Medical information systems are still not standardized — integration remains a challenge.  
- Cells and robotic components share structural similarities, which makes them a strong model for research.  
- I prefer working with physical signals (like movement) that I can sense and model mathematically, rather than biochemical ones that feel too abstract.  
- Neural interfaces: imagining brain signals being decoded into actions (e.g., cursor movement, wearable robots, or prosthetics).  
- Prosthetics are advancing: EMG patterns can already be used for natural walking or restoring tactile sensation.  
- Cochlear implants made me wonder: could we extend hearing into entirely new domains (e.g., infrared or ultraviolet perception)?

## Neuroscience & Brain-Inspired Computing
- Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the squid giant axon with just four equations — I want to study this more.  
- The Human Brain Project: is it really possible to represent the brain mathematically?  
- Computational neuroscience might be the most artistic form of science: expressing the brain through equations.  
- OpenWorm Project: simulating *C. elegans* using its connectome. The idea of capturing synaptic weights feels like poetry in science.  
- Brain chips (hippocampal prosthetics) could one day store memory and experience — opening incredible possibilities.  
- Could we one day upload thoughts directly to Instagram or compose music by pure intention?

## Technology & Society
- Cybernetics: Wiener at MIT proposed that mimicking brain structure more faithfully could push AI forward — but this raises concerns about machines overtaking humans.  
- Neuralink: Musk demonstrated pigs with electrodes capturing brain signals in real time.  
- If we can record and interpret brain signals, could we develop personalized learning methods, or even experience other people’s minds?

## Personal Connections
- I often feel out of place because I think differently, but I realized this isn’t a weakness — it’s where my creativity lies.  
- During a small class project, others wanted to just analyze facial expressions. I wanted to push further — to make the analysis meaningful for real applications. That mismatch was hard, but the professor valued my perspective.  
- Ballet and computer science both trained me to get used to technical jargon, even when it felt intimidating at first.  
- I want to change the image of wearable robotics — from masculine, industrial gear to something friendlier and more inclusive, even artistic.  
- Sometimes I wonder: could dopamine levels during art experiences be measured? Could we replicate that “floating” feeling through brain stimulation?

## Future Dreams
- I’d love to work in labs that embrace unconventional ideas, where “wild” projects are encouraged rather than dismissed.  
- I want to make technologies that affect not just niche groups but the broader public.  
- I dream of blending neuroscience, AI, and art — building systems that don’t just process data, but also create new forms of expression.  
- Maybe even a company where brain-computer interfaces handle work for us — like a personal assistant that executes tasks directly from thought.

## Open Questions
- How did scientists first interpret the meaning of signals like mitochondrial energy production?  
- Why was *C. elegans* chosen for connectome mapping?  
- What exactly is meant by “synaptic weight” in the context of OpenWorm?  
- Could studying brain activity while experiencing art reveal how creativity and emotion blend into new sensations?  
- If emotions can be artificially triggered by electrodes, does that cheapen the value of art, or expand it?
