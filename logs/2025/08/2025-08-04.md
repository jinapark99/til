> **Today I Learned**  
Key concepts and pitfalls around usability studies, bias during interviews, and how to moderate or structure UX research more effectively — based on Coursera UX Research Module 1 & 2.

---

## 📘 Usability Study Timing & Moderation

- Usability studies can be conducted at multiple stages:
  - 💡 During early concept testing (low-fidelity prototypes)
  - 🧪 During interactive prototyping (before product launch)
  - ✅ Even after the product is complete (to test real usage)
- Moderated usability tests allow follow-up questions, but risk **moderator bias**.
- Unmoderated usability tests offer flexibility, but:
  - Lack environmental control
  - Do not support real-time troubleshooting
  - Use fixed questions only, so emotional or contextual insights are limited

---

## 🧠 Interview Bias Awareness

- **Common biases in UX interviews:**
  - *Friendliness bias*: Agreeing or reacting positively alters participant responses
  - *Implicit/unconscious bias*: Researcher unknowingly affects the outcome
  - *Self-serving bias*: Researcher interprets feedback to protect ego
  - *Serial position effect*: First/last items in a task sequence are more remembered
- Avoid leading questions; instead:
  - Use open-ended prompts like:  
    _“What part of this was difficult and why?”_

---

## 🧾 NDA Purpose in UX Studies

- Prevents participants from sharing test content externally
- Builds trust with at-risk or marginalized participant groups

---

## 📊 Recording & Categorizing Observations

- Observation spreadsheets can include:
  - Voice tone, hesitation, confidence
  - Indirect behavior patterns
  - Navigation route → **Click path**
- “Click path” was explicitly mentioned in spreadsheet example columns  
  in the course and is considered the correct Coursera answer,  
  though "Observation" is acceptable in real-world practice

---

## 💬 Personal Insights

- Repeating participant comments back to them allows clarification without assuming intent
- Emotional cues (e.g., sharp tone) should be followed up with neutral questions like:  
  _“How did you feel at that moment?”_ instead of direct interpretation

## ✅ Reflection

Today helped solidify:
- When and how usability testing fits into the product life cycle
- What biases to watch for when moderating sessions
- The practical limits of unmoderated testing
- How to translate observational data into structured UX artifacts
