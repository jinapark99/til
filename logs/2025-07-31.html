<h1>üìò Today I Learned ‚Äì Theorem 31.2 (GCD and Linear Combination)</h1>

<p>This note summarizes CLRS Section 31.1, specifically Theorem 31.2, with a focus on understanding the idea that \( \gcd(a, b) = ax + by \), how the proof works, and how I personally worked through confusing parts.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>‚úÖ Theorem 31.2 ‚Äì GCD as the Smallest Positive Linear Combination</h2>

<blockquote>
  If \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \), not both zero, then:
  $$
  \gcd(a, b) = \min\{ ax + by \mid x, y \in \mathbb{Z},\ ax + by > 0 \}
  $$
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the greatest common divisor of \( a \) and \( b \) is the smallest positive value that can be expressed as a linear combination of them.</p>

<h3>üß† Proof Summary (Direct Proof)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Let \( s = ax + by \) be the smallest positive integer of this form.</li>
  <li>Then \( a \mod s = r = a - qs \). Since \( s = ax_0 + by_0 \),</li>
</ol>
$$
r = a - q(ax_0 + by_0) = a(1 - qx_0) + b(-qy_0)
$$
<p>which is still a linear combination.</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>But since \( 0 \le r < s \), and \( s \) is the minimal positive linear combination,</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If \( r > 0 \), then it contradicts the minimality of \( s \)</li>
    <li>So \( r = 0 \Rightarrow s \mid a \)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Similarly, \( s \mid b \)</li>
  <li>Therefore, \( s \) is a common divisor, so \( \gcd(a, b) \ge s \)</li>
  <li>On the other hand, \( \gcd(a, b) \mid a, b \Rightarrow \gcd(a, b) \mid s \Rightarrow \gcd(a, b) \le s \)</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore:</p>
$$
\gcd(a, b) = s
$$

<hr/>

<h2>ü§Ø My Confusion & How I Resolved It</h2>

<h3>‚ùì My question: "GCD means <em>greatest</em>, but this s is defined as the <em>smallest</em> ‚Äì how can they be the same?"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>\( \gcd(a, b) \) is the greatest among <em>common divisors</em>, but</li>
  <li>\( s \) is the smallest <em>positive linear combination</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The surprising fact is:</p>
$$
\text{Smallest positive } ax + by = \text{Greatest common divisor of } a, b
$$

<h3>‚ùì Why isn‚Äôt this a proof by contradiction?</h3>
<p>This proof is not a contradiction proof ‚Äì it's a direct proof.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It assumes \( s \) is minimal, then shows anything smaller leads to contradiction.</li>
  <li>But it never assumes something false to derive a contradiction.</li>
  <li>So we just use minimality directly and finish with two inequalities.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>üìå Corollary 31.3 ‚Äì Every Common Divisor Divides the GCD</h2>
<blockquote>
  If \( d \mid a \) and \( d \mid b \), then \( d \mid \gcd(a, b) \)
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Since \( \gcd(a, b) = ax + by \) and \( d \mid a, b \), then clearly \( d \mid ax + by \).</p>

<hr/>

<h2>üìå Corollary 31.4 ‚Äì GCD Scales with Multiples</h2>
<blockquote>
  \( \gcd(an, bn) = n \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> If \( \gcd(a, b) = s \), then:</p>
$$
anx + bny = n(ax + by) = ns
$$
<p>So the minimal linear combination also scales by \( n \).</p>
