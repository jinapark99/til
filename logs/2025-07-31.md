# 📘 Today I Learned – Theorem 31.2 (GCD and Linear Combination)

This note summarizes CLRS Section 31.1, specifically Theorem 31.2, with a focus on understanding the idea that $\gcd(a, b) = ax + by$, how the proof works, and how I personally worked through confusing parts.

---

## ✅ Theorem 31.2 – GCD as the Smallest Positive Linear Combination

> If $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, not both zero, then:
>
> $$
> \gcd(a, b) = \min\{ ax + by \mid x, y \in \mathbb{Z},\ ax + by > 0 \}
> $$

In other words, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the smallest positive value that can be expressed as a linear combination of them.

### 🧠 Proof Summary (Direct Proof)

1. Let $s = ax + by$ be the smallest positive integer of this form.
2. Then $a \mod s = r = a - qs$. Since $s = ax_0 + by_0$,

   $$
   r = a - q(ax_0 + by_0) = a(1 - qx_0) + b(-qy_0)
   $$

   which is still a linear combination.
3. But since $0 \le r < s$, and $s$ is the minimal positive linear combination,

   * If $r > 0$, then it contradicts the minimality of $s$
   * So $r = 0 \Rightarrow s \mid a$
4. Similarly, $s \mid b$
5. Therefore, $s$ is a common divisor, so $\gcd(a, b) \ge s$
6. On the other hand, $\gcd(a, b) \mid a, b \Rightarrow \gcd(a, b) \mid s \Rightarrow \gcd(a, b) \le s$
7. Therefore:

$$
\gcd(a, b) = s
$$

## 🤯 My Confusion & How I Resolved It

### ❓ My question: "GCD means *greatest*, but this s is defined as the *smallest* – how can they be the same?"

* $\gcd(a, b)$ is the greatest among *common divisors*, but
* $s$ is the smallest *positive linear combination*.
* The surprising fact is:

$$
\text{Smallest positive } ax + by = \text{Greatest common divisor of } a, b
$$

### ❓ Why isn’t this a proof by contradiction?

Good question! This proof is not a contradiction proof – it's a direct proof.

* It assumes $s$ is minimal, then shows anything smaller leads to contradiction.
* But it never assumes something false to derive a contradiction.
* So we just use minimality directly and finish with two inequalities.

## 📌 Corollary 31.3 – Every Common Divisor Divides the GCD

> If $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$, then $d \mid \gcd(a, b)$

**Proof:** Since $\gcd(a, b) = ax + by$ and $d \mid a, b$, then clearly $d \mid ax + by$.

---

## 📌 Corollary 31.4 – GCD Scales with Multiples

> $\gcd(an, bn) = n \cdot \gcd(a, b)$

**Proof:** If $\gcd(a, b) = s$, then:

$$
anx + bny = n(ax + by) = ns
$$

So the minimal linear combination also scales by $n$.
